A NextJs SPA that utilizes Prismic.io CDN

I have wrote a tutorial on how to use [surge](http://surge.sh) and CDN such as [Prismic.io](http://prismic.io/).

This project contains the code for the same.

## How to run

- clone the repository
- run below commands,
  ```
  cd bulletin
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
